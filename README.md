## READ: Automatic Reading Tutor - Frontend
The Automatic Reading Tutor, an open-source web application, has been developed to address significant literacy challenges in South Africa. Tailored primarily for English speakers, this
tool uses advanced speech recognition technology to enhance reading proficiency among adult
and older child learners. 

Despite not pinpointing specific mispronounced words, the application
successfully indicates reading inaccuracies and provides immediate, automated feedback on overall reading performance. Users receive visual cues and corrective assistance in real-time, which
helps in fostering self-directed learning and improvement. 

Additionally, the tool collects and
presents data on user progress, including reading speed and accuracy, although its effectiveness
can vary with accent differences due to its reliance on standard speech recognition models. This
limitation notwithstanding, the Automatic Reading Tutor represents a significant step forward in
educational technology, offering substantial support to learners striving to improve their reading
skills in challenging environments.
